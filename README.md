# HackTo2020
Project: Covid-19 The Game

Our project is built with Java through the processing IDE and 
requires the installation of the Sound library in order to listen to the
sound effects and music.

The sound library can be downloaded through going on the sketch tab of the
processing IDE and adding a library called Sound.
